# react-portfolio

[Deployed Site](http://benferriman.com/)

## Description

The site was developed to serve as my presence on the web, particularly for prospective employers.  It contains a bio, contact information, links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and my resume, and some of my projects.

Evolved from my ludicrously misnamed [portfolio-final](https://github.com/bferriman/portfolio-final), this version has been rebuilt using React and received a few cosmetic improvements as well.

## Opportunities For Further Development

I would like to add a button for each portfolio project that you can click to pull up more detailed information on the project - more detailed description of the functionality, technologies used, and so on.

I would like to add some subtle animations to make the site come alive a little bit.
